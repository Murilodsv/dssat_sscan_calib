Improvements for calibration procedure:

- global minimum threshold                      (to stop iterations earlier when a threshold is achieved)
- write best set of parameters in .cul and .eco (link to https://github.com/Murilodsv/R-scripts/tree/master/dspar_sccan_f)
- write sim x obs values for the best set       (better assess final results)
